SimpleCaptcha - A Java library for creating CAPTCHAs for J2EE applications,
including Spring MVC, Struts, and Grails.

Example implementations are located in the examples/ directory. The more robust
examples were done using Grails; this is the recommended starting point for how
to implement and use SimpleCaptcha.
