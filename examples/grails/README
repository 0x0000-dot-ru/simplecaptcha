This directory contains the Grails application used to test SimpleCaptcha. To run:

    # grails run-app

Once it has started simply browse to:

    http://localhost:8080/sc

The source code used to generate these CAPTCHAs is available under:

    grails-app/controllers/

Most of these use the builder class, but one (SpringController.groovy) shows a simple example of configuring SimpleCaptcha using Spring. The corresponding Spring definition file is available located here:

    grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy
