This directory contains the Grails application used to test SimpleCaptcha. It requires two libraries, included in the download: imaging.jar and simplecaptcha.jar. These need to be in the lib/ directory before the app will run. You can either copy them there, or create symbolic links to them if your OS supports it:

    # ln -s ../../../lib/imaging.jar .
    # ln -s ../../../dist/simplecaptcha.jar .

Then to run:

    grails run-app

Once it has started simply browse to:

    http://localhost:8080/sc

The source code used to generate these CAPTCHAs is available under:

    grails-app/controllers/

Most of these use the builder class, but one (SpringController.groovy) shows a simple example of configuring SimpleCaptcha using Spring. The corresponding Spring definition file is available located here:

    grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy
