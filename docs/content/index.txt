SimpleCaptcha is a framework used in generating CAPTCHA challenge/answer pairs for Java (J2EE, Grails, JavaFX, etc.). Both image and audio CAPTCHAs can be generated. SimpleCaptcha is intended to be simple to implement and provide sensible defaults, while providing easily-accesssible hooks for customization.  Example implementations are provided for J2EE and Grails.

Here are some example images which were generated by SimpleCaptcha:

|!/i/example_multi.png!|
|!/i/example_chinese.png!|
|!/i/example_outline_noisy.png!|
|!/i/example_big.png!|

Internationalization is supported, with the ability to generate Chinese and Arabic image CAPTCHAs provided out-of-the-box.

SimpleCaptcha is open source software under the BSD License.
