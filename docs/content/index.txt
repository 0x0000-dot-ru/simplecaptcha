p(title). Introduction

SimpleCaptcha is a framework used in generating CAPTCHA image/answer pairs for
Java (J2EE, Grails, JavaFX, etc.). It is intended to be simple to implement and
provide sensible defaults, while having the ability to be customized in a wide
variety of ways. Example implementations are provided in Java/J2EE and Grails.

Here are some example images which were generated by SimpleCaptcha:

|!/i/example_multi.png!|
|!/i/example_chinese.png!|
|!/i/example_outline_noisy.png!|
|!/i/example_big.png!|

Internationalization is supported, with Chinese CAPTCHAs provided out-of-the-box.
